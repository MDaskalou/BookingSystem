# BookingSystem
Project Idea (Scenario)
Brief Description:
The project aims to develop a digital booking system for ECT treatments at Sahlgrenska Hospital. The system will facilitate the administration and scheduling of treatment appointments for staff and optimize patient flow management efficiently.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Background & Purpose:
ECT treatment requires careful planning and coordination between different departments. Currently, bookings are handled manually (via phone calls and fax), which can lead to inefficiencies and risks of missed documentation. A digital system would improve workflows, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance patient safety.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Vision & Goals
Vision/Problem Statement:
The goal is to create a secure and efficient booking system for the ECT department that reduces manual administration and provides better oversight of planned treatments.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Clear Objectives:

Implement a digital booking platform for healthcare staff.
Enable seamless management of bookings, cancellations, and prioritizations.
Create a notification functionality to reduce missed treatment sessions.
Integrate a secure documentation module for patient data, ensuring GDPR compliance and patient confidentiality.
Improve coordination between different hospital departments.
Project success can be measured by:

Reduced number of manual errors in the booking process.
Increased user interaction and efficiency among healthcare personnel.
Fewer missed treatment sessions.
Improved time efficiency.
